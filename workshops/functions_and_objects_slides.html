# What was hard?

* Testing
* Constructor functions / Classes
* the `board` method - encapsulation
* How to get going?
* ?
---
# Testing

* QUnit
* Mocha
* Which one to use?
---
# Mocha

* DSL for Testing
* DSL : `Domain Specific Language`

** For example: **

```javascript

var assert = require("assert");

describe("In the ferry kata ", function(){
    it("I should be able to create cars", function(){
        //Assemble
        //Act
        //Assert
        assert.equal("car", "car");
    });
});
```
---

# Constructor functions / Classes

How to create a Car & Ferry!? :-|

Let's look at functions...

---

# What is a function?

* An operation that performs an action and returns the results.

* An operation that takes parameters, perform an action using the parameters and then return a result.

* can have a name

---

# Function examples

> Create a function that takes a sentence and return the number of words in the sentence.

Create the function like this:

```javascript
var wordCount = function(sentence){
    if(!sentence){
        return 0;
    }
    var wordsInSentence = sentence.split(" ");
    return wordsInSentence.length;
}
```

Call the function like this:

```javascript
var count = wordCount("The fox jumps over the fence");
console.log(count);
```
---

# Function example using node module

> Create a function that takes a sentence and return the number of words in the sentence.

Create the function like this:

```javascript
module.exports = function(sentence){

    if(!sentence){
        return 0;
    }
    var wordsInSentence = sentence.split(" ");
    return wordsInSentence.length;
    
}
```

Call the function like this:

```javascript
var wordCount = require('./wordcount');
var count = wordCount("The fox jumps over the fence");
console.log(count);
```

---

# Test it with Mocha:

```javascript

describe("The wordCount function", function(){
    it("should return the number of words in the sentence", function(){
        //Assemble & Act
        var wordsInSentence = wordCount("The fox jumps over the fence");
        //Assert
        assert.equal(wordsInSentence, 6);
    });
});

```

---

# Why are functions usefull?

---

# Why are functions usefull?

 * Hide logic
 * Call a piece of code over and over by name
 * Write logic once & reuse

---

# Why are functions usefull?

  * Hide logic
  * Call a piece of code over and over by name
  * Write logic once & reuse

```javascript

console.log(wordCount("How long is this sentence?"));

console.log(wordCount("Is this sentence another length or what?"));

console.log(wordCount("I am sure that this sentence is longer than the other ones?"));
```

---
# Scope

When variables are visible...

In Javascript it's different!

---
# Function level scope

Javascript have function level scope. This means variable scope is function wide and not specific to a block;

```javascript
    var myFunc = function(name){
        var msg = "";
        if (name.length > 10){
            var length = name.length;
            msg = "long";
        }
        else{
            msg = "short";
        }

        //this variable will exists and will have a value some times!
        console.log(length);

        return msg;
    };

```

---

# Block level scope...

Python have block level scope

```python
def myFunc (name):
    msg = ""
    if (len(name) > 10):
        # length only exists in this block...
        length = len(name)
        msg = "long"
    else:
        msg = "short"

    # this will not be initialized - this is always an error!
    print length
    return msg
```
---

# Function level scope

It's best practice in Javascript to declare all your variables on top

```javascript
    var myFunc = function(name){
        //declare all variable on top
        var msg = "";
        var length = 0;
        // all variable declared
        if (name.length > 10){
            length = name.length;
            msg = "long";
        }
        else{
            msg = "short";
        }
        //this now always have a value...
        console.log(length);
        return msg;
    };

```

# Higher order functions

* Take a function as a parameter
* can return a function as a result

# Higher order functions

[More details here](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

Functions that can:
* Take a function as a parameter
* can return a function as a result

```javascript
var removeShortWords = function(list){
    var results = [];
    for(var i=0;i<list.length;i++){
        if(list[i].length > 5){
            results.push(list[i]);
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```
---
# Higher order functions

Create a higher order function:

```javascript
var wordCount = function(sentence, filterFunc){
    if(!sentence){
        return 0;
    }
    var wordsInSentence = filterFunc(sentence.split(" "));
    return wordsInSentence.length;
}
```

Use it:

```javascript

wordCount("this is using higher order functions", removeShortWords)

//or use an inline function
wordCount("this is a using higher order functions and it is great!", function(words){
    var results = [];
    for(var i=0;i<list.length;i++){
        if(list[i].indexOf("a") !== -1){
            results.push(list[i]);
        }
    }
    return results;
});

```

# When do we need functions?

* Decide
* Transform
* Act

> We when we want to remember / Keep state for longer. We need something more

**State:**

> The state of a digital logic circuit or computer program is a technical term for all the stored information, at a given instant in time, to which the circuit or program has access - `Wikipedia`

---

# Functions evolved...

Create a function that takes a sentence and return the number of words in the sentence.

And keeps track of the number of sentences and the total number of words it seen in the sentences it processed.

**How do we do that?**

What **state** do we need to keep?

---

# Functions evolved...

** We can try this: **

```javascript
var totalWordCounter = 0;
var totalSentenceCounter = 0;

var currentSentenceLength = wordCount("How long is this sentence?");
console.log(currentSentenceLength);
totalSentenceCounter++;
totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;

wordCount("Is this sentence another length or what?");
console.log(currentSentenceLength);
totalSentenceCounter++;
totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;

wordCount("I am sure that this sentence is longer than the other ones?");
console.log(currentSentenceLength);
totalSentenceCounter++;
totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;

console.log(totalSentenceCounter);
console.log(totalWordCounter);

```
---

# Functions evolved...

This is messy!
* Hard to understand
* Lots of code
* Lots of repitition

**There should be a better way!**

* Constructor functions: Class
* Object Orientation : combine state & behaviour

---

# Classes

Create an instance that encapsulate logic.

> ** Encapsulation ** :
    * hides internal state
    * expose actions and attributes.

```javascript

// Constructor functions start with a Capital letter
var WordCounter = function(){
    this.totalSentenceCounter = 0;
    this.totalWordCounter = 0;
    this.countWords = function(sentence){
        if(!sentence){
            return 0;
        }
        var wordsInSentence = sentence.split(" ");
        this.totalSentenceCounter++;
        this.totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;
        return wordsInSentence.length;
    }
};

```
---

# Classes

Use it like this:

```javascript
    //create an instance using `new`
    // using the new operator is very important
    var myWordCounter = new WordCounter();
    myWordCounter.countWords("How long is this sentence?");
    myWordCounter.countWords("Is this sentence another length or what?");
    myWordCounter.countWords("I am sure that this sentence is longer than the other ones?");

    console.log(myWordCounter.totalSentenceCounter);
    console.log(myWordCounter.totalWordCounter);

    //create another instance
    var yourWordCounter = new WordCounter();
    yourWordCounter.countWords("Your sentence is something totally different");

    console.log(yourWordCounter.totalSentenceCounter);
    console.log(yourWordCounter.totalWordCounter);

```
---

# Classes - constructor parameters:

> Let's ignore sentences that is longer than a specified length.

We can do that using a ** Constructor ** parameter.

Give the object some runtime state to use.

---

# Classes - constructor parameters:

Let's ignore sentences that is longer than a specified length.

```javascript
// Constructor functions start with a Capital letter
var WordCounter = function(maxWords){
    this.totalSentenceCounter = 0;
    this.totalWordCounter = 0;
    this.countWords = function(sentence){
        if(!sentence) return 0;
        var wordsInSentence = sentence.split(" ");

        //ignore sentences that is longer than the specified length
        if (wordsInSentence > maxWords) return 0;

        this.totalSentenceCounter++;
        this.totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;
        return wordsInSentence.length;
    }
};

//if you use Node you can export from a module like this
//module.exports = WordCounter

```
**Write a test for this change using Mocha...**

---

# Classes Factory function

You can do the same thing without using `this` because Javascript have function level scope and support closures.

[See more details here](http://ericleads.com/2013/01/javascript-constructor-functions-vs-factory-functions/)

```javascript
// Constructor functions start with a Capital letter
var WordCounter = function(maxWords){
    var totalSentenceCounter = 0;
    var totalWordCounter = 0;
    var countWords = function(sentence){
        if(!sentence) return 0;
        var wordsInSentence = sentence.split(" ");
        //ignore sentences that is longer than the specified length
        if (wordsInSentence > maxWords) return 0;
        totalSentenceCounter++;
        totalWordCounter += wordsInSentence.length;
        return wordsInSentence.length;
    };

    return {
        totalWordCounter : totalWordCounter,
        totalSentenceCounter : totalSentenceCounter,
        countWords : countWords
    }
};
```
---
# Classes Factory function

Instantiating with out `new` is fine now...

```javascript
    // the global namespace is save now...
    var wordCounter = WordCounter(7);
    wordCounter.countWords("How long is this sentence?");
    console.log(wordCounter.totalWordCounter);
```
