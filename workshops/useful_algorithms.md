## Data structure

Data structured appropriatly for the task at hand.

## Practicals

* Create a function:
  * that can read a file and create a list of maps for each line in the [Itemised cell phone](ItemisedBill.csv) bill
  * that can return all the phone calls for the specified provider
  * that calculates the total number of calls made to numbers of each cellphone operator
  * that can calculate the duration in seconds for a call duration which is in the format `00h00m00s`
  * that can order the calls by ascending call duration
  * that can create sub totals for each cell phone operator and add it below each cellphone operator in the list
  * that takes a [handlebars template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) and create an itemized bill with totals that are nicely formatted. Add lines to the report that indicates when the calls for a Cell Phone Provider starts and a total row after the last line for each Provider displaying the total call duration for calls to that operator.
